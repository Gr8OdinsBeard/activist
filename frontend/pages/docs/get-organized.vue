            There will be so much more to an <strong>event</strong> on activist
            than a time and a place. We want to create an ecosystem of tools
            that allows organizers to onboard new joiners; keep track of all the
            tasks that need to be done to make the event a success; enable
            discussions with other organizations while providing event
            organizers with a direct voice to those attending; as well as
            provide needed information to make sure that everyone is safe and
            knows their rights while participating.
          </p>
          <p>
            One event is never enough though, so activist has the goal of
            linking political actions so that everyone involved knows the steps
            needed to have the biggest effect. Pre- and post-events will build
            and maintain momentum, while events hosted by more than one
            organization will allow for easier collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Events and organizations will also be able to create and organize
            <strong>resources</strong> to make their work easier. Resources can
            include anything from news stories to spread information; images and
            graphs that make a strong point for action; research articles to
            expand knowledge about an issue; and much more.
